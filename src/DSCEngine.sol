 * @title DSCEngine
 * @author Wozacosta
 * 
 * The system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and have the tokens
 * maintain a 1 token == $1 peg.
 * This stablecoin has those properties:
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 * - Dollar pegged
 * - Algorithmically stable
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no fees, and was only
 * backed by wETH and wBTC.
 * @notice This contract is the core of the Decentralized Stablecoin system. It handles all the logic
 * for minting and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing and withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is based on the MakerDAO DSS system // https://github.com/makerdao/dss
